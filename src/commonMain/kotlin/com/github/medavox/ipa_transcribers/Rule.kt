/**Specifies one replacement rule, from a Regex matching native text,
 * to the IPA characters corresponding to them.
 *
 *  Features:
 - optionally specify number of letters consumed, if different from match length
 - (per-rule) either a string or lambda. The lambda can access state persisting across the whole string
 - execute a lambda function on no rule matched

In Russian, we need to know the previous consonant to check if it can be softened;
but we also need to print out the following vowel so we don't reprocess it again as a word-initial.

this would mean one rule for every pair of softenable consonant + softening vowel,
or 5 * 15 = 75 rules.

this is bad, because it doesn't scale for languages with even more combination sounds.

So instead we need to be able to 'look back' at previous, consumed letters -- preferably in a Regex-friendly way.
instead of feeding the chopped-off string (with the characters consumed so far removed) to one regex,
we have to match regexes on two strings: the consumed-so-far characters AND the unconsumed characters.
The regex for the consumed-so-far string is optional.
