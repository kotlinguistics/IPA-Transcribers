/**Status:COMPLETE
 * All the 'modern' combining jamo have been transcribed.
 *
 * All Unicode combining-character syllable-initial consonants have been transcribed
 * (unicode block U+1100 - U+1112).
 * All Unicode combining-character vowels have been transcribed (Unicode block U+1161 - U+1175).
 * For Unicode combining-character syllable-final consonants: the simple ones have been transcribed -
 * jamo which are only a single 'plain' letter.
 *
 * Jamo for syllable-final consonant clusters and their liaison (sandhi) rules have been transcribed,
 * thanks to Duolingo (21 June 2019).
 *
 * The liaison: a syllable-final but not word-final consonant is pronounced as part of the
 * next syllable, if the next syllable starts with the null consonant 'ᄋ'.
