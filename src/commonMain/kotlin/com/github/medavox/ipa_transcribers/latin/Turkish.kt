    /*Vowel harmony of grammatical suffixes is realized through "a chameleon-like quality",[16]
     meaning that the vowels of suffixes change to harmonize with the vowel of the preceding syllable.
     According to the changeable vowel, there are two patterns:

    * twofold (/e/~/a/):[17] Backness is preserved, that is, /e/ appears following a front vowel and
      /a/ appears following a back vowel.
      For example, the locative suffix is -de after front vowels and -da after back vowels.
      The notation -de2 is shorthand for this pattern.
    * fourfold (/i/~/y/~/ɯ/~/u/): Both backness and rounding are preserved.
      For example, the genitive suffix is -in after unrounded front vowels, -ün after rounded front vowels,
       -ın after unrounded back vowels, and -un after rounded back vowels.
       The notation -in4 can be this pattern's shorthand.*/
