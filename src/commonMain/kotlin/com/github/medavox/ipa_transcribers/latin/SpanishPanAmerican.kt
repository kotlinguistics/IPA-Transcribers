    /**
     METHODOLOGY
    ============

    all "before" and "after" rules can be encoded here as digraphs,
    even if this produces a lot of rules (eg, before a voiced consonant).

    It's still simpler than creating an entire IPA-structure in code,
    to look back at the voicedness of the last (or next) letter.

    Digraphs require less code, but more rules.

    We do however need to be able to distinguish Spanish syllable boundaries,
    for two reasons:

    1. Some rules are encoded as syllable-final or syllable-initial.
     We need to know what part of the current syllable we're at.

    2. Barring words that have specific accent-markers, Spanish word stress has rules along the lines of falling
    on the final or penultimate syllable.
    We need to know which syllable of the word we're on, so we know which one to mark for stress in the IPA.

    (having looked at the rules for syllabification in Spanish, we don't need the Spanish sonority hierarchy.)
